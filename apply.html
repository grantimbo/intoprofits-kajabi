Hey [NAME],

I know you’re [DOING X RIGHT NOW] and wanting to grow your business. I recently joined a training program that helped me [WITH X] and I think it could really help you too.

You can get a free consultation with Daniel (the creator) to see if this is a good fit for you and your business by using this short form: https://intoprofits.com/apply

Make sure you mention my name on the form because if you join as my friend you’ll get a massive $2,000 discount.

This program transformed my business and I know it can do the same for you.

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
